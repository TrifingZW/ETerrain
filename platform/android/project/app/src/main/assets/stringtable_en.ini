stage_intro_10101 = The Supreme Command has decided to launch an attack on Poland. The Command orders you to lead your army to break through the border of Poland at the fastest speed. We are looking forward to hearing from your victory.
stage_intro_10102 = According to the latest intelligence, the Supreme Command believes that the British troops may march towards Norway and threaten our iron ore supplies. The Command orders you to deploy troops to Norway and Denmark in the name of 'Operation Weserubung' and make sure that the resources needed for the empire are in our own hands.
stage_intro_10103 = In an effort to annihilate France, the Command sets Paris, the French capital, as the ultimate goal of this battle. The French have built the strong Maginot line, which is the biggest obstacle to our invasion. But as long as we bypass it, the French defense will become useless.
stage_intro_10104 = Now that France has surrendered, Britain becomes our biggest enemy. Its presence will make it impossible for us to move east with ease. The Supreme Command orders you to cross the English Channel and eliminate the British once and for all. Remove the threats to the European continent.
stage_intro_10105 = Recently, the British navy has become more and more active in the Mediterranean sea. This not only affects our operation plans in North Africa, but also threatens our territorial security. The Prime Minister orders you to regain control of the Mediterranean. It is of great importance to our country and our allies.
stage_intro_10106 = Our allies' victories bring great confidence to the Prime Minister. He decides to revive the glory of the Rome empire. According to his policy of expansion, we will begin our military operations in the Balkans Peninsula. Our allies, Romania and Bulgaria, will assist us. The prime minister is looking forward to your good news!
stage_intro_10107 = The Supreme Command has decided to launch the Barbarossa operation. Its ultimate goal is to capture Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. We will continue to use 'Blitzkrieg' and beat the Soviet Union at the fastest speed. The empire will gain plenty of oil and a large number of labors, both of which are critical resources to us.
stage_intro_10108 = The allies' attacks prevent us from taking over the Suez Canal and Port Alexandria. At the same time, our supplies are getting much tighter. We must fight off the allies entrenched there and cut off their supply lines, so that we can control the entire North African region.
stage_intro_10109 = Leningrad is one of the most important cities of the Soviet Union. The Supreme Command considers its importance higher than Moscow. The capture of the city is of great strategic significance to the empire. The Command has mobilized the entire northern army, and the Finland regiment will fight with us.
stage_intro_10110 = General Paulus's Sixth Army has fallen into the tight encirclement of the Soviet army. The Supreme Command orders you to rescue them at all costs immediately! The Command has mobilized the surrounding troops as reinforcements. Hope that you gain the control of Stalingrad while rescuing successfully.
stage_intro_10111 = The partial failure of the Barbarossa plan comes from the fact that we underestimated the enemy. The Supreme Command believes it has no effect on the empire's conquest of the entire Europe. Now there is only one step away from conquering Europe! Take Moscow and fulfill the remaining part of the Barbarossa plan.
stage_intro_10201 = Our allies' defense line is on the edge of collapsing under German army's fast attack. Now that the coalition forces are besieged in Dunkirk, the English channel behind is the only way out. The headquarters has given the order that we must resist the German army at all costs and buy more time for the main force.
stage_intro_10202 = The retreat in Dunkirk costs us nearly all the heavy equipment. The crazy attack of the German exhausts us from defending and makes it impossible for our army to fight back. The headquarters has handed the remaining superior equipment to you and the troops around. You are Britain's last hope.
stage_intro_10203 = We have sunken many German supply ships on their way to Tunisia. Now the German army in North Africa are in lack of supply. This is a good chance to completely drive the Germans out. But the terrain in Tunis is complex and the Germans have built quite a line of defense. This battle is not as easy as it seems.
stage_intro_10204 = The axis forces in North Africa have been defeated. Only when Italy withdraws from the war can the Mediterranean sea be completely under our control. The headquarters has ordered you and your troops to attack Sicily. This will be the first step for the allies to liberate the European continent.
stage_intro_10205 = The Command has received intelligence that the Germans have assembled a large number of artillery and tanks and they are about to launch a large-scale attack on us. There is no doubt that this campaign will affect the situation in the future. This is a great test for you. We must win for our dear motherland!
stage_intro_10206 = It is always claimed by the German radio that they are invincible. But it all seems quite ridiculous in the presence of our continuous victories. The Command orders you to take Kiev back. We will back you up with intensive gunfire to avoid potential casualties.
stage_intro_10207 = Our advance unit has arrived the Belarus area. This time we shall completely eliminate the German army within our territory. Germany has mobilized the reserve troops to supplement their losses in the early battles. You'd better break through their defense before their reinforcements come and liberate every single piece of land in our country.
stage_intro_10208 = For a quick close of the war, we must open up a new battlefield in Europe. The headquarters has made the final decision to set the attack site on the Normandy direction, unexpected by the enemy. We have been preparing for this operation for a long time. This will be the biggest battle that you have ever participated.
stage_intro_10209 = Our actions have achieved staged victory. The headquarters has given the latest order that you and your forces will recover all the lands in south France and destroy the remaining German troops there, bringing the southern port back to operation. This will play a crucial role in the war situation.
stage_intro_10210 = To cross the Rhine directly and expose Berlin completely in front of our allies, the headquarters decides to implement a large-scale airborne operation. But the Germans will not easily give up their last natural barrier. So once the action begins, you and your troops will fight in hell.
stage_intro_10211 = The Germans are gathering their last strength to defend their capital Berlin. Although the allies outnumber the German army, the desperate Germans will definitely put up a fight. The headquarters hopes you can take the lead in controlling Berlin before other countries arrive.
stage_intro_10301 = The Pacific fleet of the United States is the biggest obstacle to the expansion of the empire, so it has to be destroyed. We are about to launch a surprise attack drawn by the Tokyo headquarters. Our target is the Pearl Harbor of the United States Naval base. The empire's fleet will help you at sea. Capture Hawaii and crush the Pacific fleet into pieces.
stage_intro_10302 = Under the German fierce attack, Britain has no time to take into account his interests in Asia. For the sake of more resources, the headquarters orders you to attack the British colony, the Malay Peninsula, and capture Singapore. Watch out for the British royal fleets. They have powerful firepower.
stage_intro_10303 = The British have built a road with the help of the locals through which a steady flow of goods is secured. To better fight Britain, the headquarters order you attack Burma, cutting out their supply lines. After you capture the target, be sure to hold on your ground and keep the highway under imperial control.
stage_intro_10304 = The headquarters has locked its next target on Australia, but before attacking Australia, we need to capture the surrounding areas and build a series of defense facilities, cutting off the supply lines between the United States and Australia. The landing operations will start as soon as our fleet arrives at the designated area.
stage_intro_10305 = The time is ripe. Now it is the best time to attack Australia. The headquarters requires you and your troops to attack from the land, occupying all coastal cities. The navy of the empire will give you full support from the sea. Watch out! Our forces are limited, so we must reduce unnecessary costs.
stage_intro_10306 = The operation of attacking the Imphal region has failed. Our troops suffer from heavy losses. But the British army are still chasing after us. This is likely to turn into a full-scale defeat. The headquarters commands you to build a line of defense on the spot to hold off their attack.
stage_intro_10307 = The war between Germany and the Soviet Union has entered the final stage. To defeat the Soviet Union as soon as possible, Germany hopes we can attack the Soviets in the Far East so as to effectively pin down their main forces in Siberia. Watch out! We are no match for the strong armored forces of the Soviet Union.
stage_intro_10308 = With the intention to invade North America with the Germans, the headquarters has decided to attack Canada at first. This is the longest-distance marine operation that we've ever done. Your fleet needs to break through Canada's coastal line of defense. Beware of Americans! You shall not expose, otherwise we will be attacked front and rear!
stage_intro_10309 = The empire has achieved brilliant results in the battles before, but the strong United States is yet to be defeated. According to intelligence, Americans have developed a powerful weapon, which is likely to change the outcome of the war. The headquarters decides to attack the United States immediately. Clock is ticking.
stage_intro_10401 = The Japanese have raided on Pearl Harbor. Such behavior is no different as declaration of war. Our airports are blown up, and ships in the harbor are unable to fight. Now we can only rely on the patrol fleets, which is our last hope.
stage_intro_10402 = The Imperial forces are badly hit by the Japanese in Malaya. This is a huge disaster in British history. Now the Japanese are planning a new round of attack against Singapore, which is something that we can not bear. Organize counterattack and once the Royal Navy arrives, it will immediately join the battle.
stage_intro_10403 = Technical staff has deciphered the codes of Japanese telegraphs and learned that Japan plans to attack Midway Island. The Command orders you to hold the site before the arrival of reinforcements. Our aircraft carrier fleet has been sent to support you at the fastest speed. Hope you are fully prepared.
stage_intro_10404 = The headquarters orders your troops to attack Guadalcanal Island and occupy the Japanese military base there. If we gain control of the island, the air force can air-raid all the Japanese military bases in the South Pacific, better prepared for the counter offensive in Philippines. I believe that General MacArthur can't wait for that day.
stage_intro_10405 = The Japanese attempt to capture Imphal has failed, so the allied forces decide to seize the opportunity and launch a counterattack. The headquarters order you to attack the Japanese in Burma after the rainy season. The Japanese are suffering from diseases, so it is the best time to attack.
stage_intro_10406 = A comprehensive counterattack has begun. General MacArthur suggests that we capture Philippines, blocking the Japanese transport line and realizing his promise. The Command has taken his advice and orders you to cooperate with General MacArthur to ensure a successful operation.
stage_intro_10407 = In order for our 'air fortress' to effectively bomb the Japanese mainland, the headquarters orders you to capture Iwo Jim and seize the Japanese air force base. Please watch out! The Japanese have built a huge fortification on the island, and this will cost us every step on the way.
stage_intro_10408 = The U.S. military is about to launch a final attack on the Japanese mainland, but we are still dragged by the enemy here. This is unbearable to the headquarters. You must destroy the army as soon as possible, and attack the Japanese mainland before the American come. The time left is running out.
stage_intro_10409 = Although our super weapons have caused a devastating blow to Japan, it still refuses to surrender. So the headquarters decides to attack the Japan mainland. This shall be a tough fight, and landing in Japan by force will cause huge casualties. The Soviet Union will launch an attack from the north, but their targets are probably not merely Japan...
stage_intro_10501 = The NATO fleets appear in the India ocean, and the headquarters believe that they intend to enter the Persian Gulf, where they can attack our oil fields in the Caucasus. To repel them, our troops deployed in the Middle East can provide effective help.
stage_intro_10502 = NATO has long coveted our oil fields in Caucasus region. According to intelligence, the enemy has started to assemble in Turkey, trying to attack our oil fields. The headquarters orders you to lead your troops to Caucasus, eliminate NATO troops there, and March towards Turkey.
stage_intro_10503 = NATO will not be sitting still while we capture Turkey. They have begun to assemble fleet in the Mediterranean sea in an attempt to stop our military operations in Turkey. Occupy Turkey and destroy the NATO fleet. The headquarters considers this a prime opportunity to gain control of the Mediterranean region.
stage_intro_10504 = NATO believes that our activities in North Africa and the Mediterranean region occupy the interests of European countries. So the western countries, led by the United States, form an alliance to fight against us. The situation is unfavorable to us. We are about to face the power of the entire Europe.
stage_intro_10505 = After losing its European allies, the United States has turned to Asia, seeking to form new alliances and forces. As long as they develop new forces in Asia, they will pose a bigger threat to us. So the headquarters hopes you to attack the west coast of the United States, cutting off their route to Asia.
stage_intro_10506 = After a number of major victories against NATO, our forces have spread throughout Europe, Asia and Africa. The United States is our ultimate target. As long as we defeat the U.S., we will win the whole war. You will face the most powerful nation in the world, whether it comes to technology or military strength.
stage_intro_10601 = The Soviet Union has bigger ambitions after its victory against Germany in the East battlefield. Obviously, they seek to gain more interests while taking advantage of the weakened European countries. At present, every country in Europe is no match for the powerful Soviet Union, so you must combine forces with other European countries to stop its expansion.
stage_intro_10602 = A full-scale war has broke out on the Korean Peninsula, and Seoul, the capital of South Korea, has fallen. This has posed a big threat to our interests in Asia. The Command has accepted General MacArthur's proposal that our reinforcements will land on the Korean Peninsula in Inchon. Please keep your eyes widely open. Our enemies are not just the North Korean army.
stage_intro_10603 = According to intelligence, the Soviet Union has recently deployed a large number of missiles in Cuba and near the Caribbean. This poses a great threat to our homeland security. The Command has ordered you to lead your troops to march to Cuba immediately, eliminating the troops there and occupying the missile silos.
stage_intro_10604 = In order to seize the oil in the Middle East, the Soviet Union has blocked the Suez canal. This sort of behavior will undoubtedly affect our deployment in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. The Command requires you to join our British allies in support of the Middle East. Drive the Soviets out and restore the navigation of the Suez Canal.
stage_intro_10605 = According to intelligence, the Soviets have mobilized tens of thousands of tanks in Poland within just a few weeks. The Command believes there is not much time left before the Soviet Union launches a comprehensive attack. We must take actions to support Europe. Commander, you will have to face a powerful war machine.
stage_intro_10606 = Although we have defeated the Soviet Union, its quick surrender is suspectable. According to Intelligence, the Soviet Union has been secretly developing new weapons at the south pole since a long time ago. The Command orders you to search for the Soviets there. Their new weapons are threatening us.
stage_intro_10701 = Our oil fields in the Middle East have been attacked and occupied. This has boosted the international oil price to historical high. Commander, there may be serious consequences if we haste to attack, but we must take back the oil fields now, otherwise there will be more and more countries fallen into crisis.
stage_intro_10702 = The situation in Europe has been very bad under the onslaught from unknown forces. As the center of the world economy, Europe has reason to restore peace as soon as possible. Commander, lead your troops to Europe and crush the unknown forces out.
stage_intro_10703 = After the failure of Western Europe, they have begun to march their troops eastward. This is a huge crisis for the Soviet union whose economy is in a state of near-collapse. Commander, the Soviet Union shall never be defeated by the enemy. It will be one of many important forces when we launch a counterattack in days to come.
stage_intro_10704 = North America is one of the earliest and most heavily attacked areas and New York is the top target of the enemy. The recent victory in Europe has greatly reduced the pressure on New York. The headquarters decides to take this opportunity and fight back, driving away the enemy from the free land for good.
stage_intro_10705 = The United Nations has defined the unknown forces as terrorists. They are always a threat to our homes and loved ones, so we have to wipe them out around the world. With the constant victories, we will gain more and more support. It is only a matter of time before they are fully destroyed.
stage_intro_10706 = Siberia has a wealth of material resources. Intelligence shows that terrorists have established a secret base aiming to attack Asian countries. The headquarters believes the base has to be cleared out, but the harsh environment in Siberia becomes their natural protection. This move could be more difficult than we expected.
stage_intro_10707 = Their actions are much faster than we thought. After the destruction of the Siberia base, they have focused the remaining troops to attack our bases in Asia. Although they have a small number of troops, the rest are the elite troops, so dealing with these desperate enemies will become quite difficult.
stage_intro_10708 = We tracked the terrorists who retreated from Washington and have found that they dispersed and then moved alone, but eventually they all came to South America. The headquarters has confirmed that it is their base. Commander, it is time for a decisive battle. Destroy them for world peace!
stage_intro_10709 = We are too careless. We wouldn't have thought that these terrorists could have taken advantage of the Antarctic military base left by the Soviet Union and completed the Soviet's unfinished research and development. This is the source of their technology. Now that the Antarctic base has grown into a fortress in their business, we must attack. Technology like this can never be fallen into the hands of terrorists.

event_intro_416 = In order to break through the German defenses in Normandy, the Allies launched multiple assist operations, diverting the majority of the German armored reserves to the British and Canadian lines. On July 25, 1944, the Allied forces concentrated their strength near Saint-Lô and launched a powerful assault against the German troops. Due to factors such as personnel shortages, lack of equipment, and low morale, the German forces were unable to mount an effective counteroffensive, resulting in the complete collapse of the western defenses in Normandy.
event_intro_417 = Capitalizing on the success of Operation Cobra, the Allies launched Operation Bluecoat on July 30, 1944, taking the initiative during the withdrawal of German armored units. The British forces effectively restrained and depleted the German armored forces on the eastern side of the front, contributing to the subsequent defeats of German counterattacks and the encirclement of German troops in the Falaise Pocket.
event_intro_418 = On August 3, 1943, the Soviet Union initiated an offensive against the northern flank of the German Army Group South, aiming to recapture the Belgorod and Kharkov regions.

event_intro_426 = The battle was the last large-scale offensive initiated by the Axis forces in the North African theater. On August 30, 1942, Rommel launched an attack on the 8th Army at the Alam el Halfa Ridge in order to avoid losing all hope of victory due to unfavorable supplies. However, the battle plan was discovered in advance by the British, and Montgomery used it to make a specialized tactical arrangement that completely dashed Rommel's last hope.

event_intro_428 = On September 3, 1943, after winning the landings in Sicily, the Allies continued their attack on the Italian mainland. Estimating that the Germans would focus their defenses south of Taranto, the Allies planned a feint south of Taranto while the main force landed at Salerno to take control of Naples.

The Allies failed to win after several attacks and eventually chose to retreat.
event_intro_434 = The Battle of Metz refers to the fierce fighting between the German 1st Army Group and the American 3rd Army Group around Metz during World War II. The Germans resisted resolutely, relying on a series of forts, and dragged the U.S. forces into a grueling battle of positions.

event_intro_435 = The Battle of Bryansk, which began on September 30, 1941, was a major German operation in the Barbarossa Plan to encircle and destroy the Soviet Red Army's Bryansk Front and clear the way for an attack on Moscow.
